# 42_libft 🚀

## 📝 About

libft is the first project from 42 School, where you have to reimplement a set of standard C library functions.
The project emphasizes:

🔹 Mastering C fundamentals

🔹 Understanding pointers and memory management

🔹 Creating modular and reusable code

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

🔹 Recreate standard C functions such as strlen, strcpy, atoi, etc.

🔹 Implement custom utility functions for string and memory manipulation

🔹 Build a personal static library (libft.a) for future projects

---

## 🧪 Testing

Compile and test with:

<pre> gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.c 
 ./a.out </pre>
 


You can also use a Makefile for easier compilation:

<pre>make </pre>
